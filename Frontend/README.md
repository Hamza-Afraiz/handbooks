# Frontend

Frontend development is the practice of coding and creating visual elements of a software, application or website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It deals with that components/features of an application which are directly viewable and accessible by the end user or client.

Here, in **eMumba**, we&#39;ve made some efforts to train our new resources in `frontend` to equip themselves with learning materials, development tools and have some assignments to practice and test their skills.
