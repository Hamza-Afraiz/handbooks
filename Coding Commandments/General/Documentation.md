*  Your project should have a README.md file describing at least how to run your project. More information is generally better. 
*  Every public class and method should have documentation (above or within the method based on language standard) describing what it does, inputs, and output.
*  Though documentation of private methods is not mandatory but it is good to have. 
*  REST api documentation should be automatically generated using tools like Swagger.
