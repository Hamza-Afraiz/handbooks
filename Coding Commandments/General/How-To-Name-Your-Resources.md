[Coding is social activity](./Programming-Is-For-People.md), hence your code needs to be clear enough so that it takes least amount of time for a new person to get up and running with your project.

Importance of naming your resources succinctly cannot be overstated. Good naming conventions can significantly improve readability of your code, and vice versa. This includes naming your:

- Modules
- Classes
- Functions
- Variables

Art of naming your resources is a skill that you can only perfect over time. But there are some guiding principles that you can keep in mind:

Use nouns for naming your modules, classes, and variables. Nouns, in English language, refer to names of things. For example, `Emumba` is a noun, or `Phone` is a noun. I highly recommend to brush off your English lessons from school from this [short video](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/grammar/parts-of-speech-the-noun/grammar-nouns/v/introduction-to-nouns-the-parts-of-speech-grammar-khan-academy).

Use verbs for naming your functions. Verbs, in English language, refer to names of actions. For example, `jump`, `get`, `set`, `go`, etc. are examples of verbs. Again, this is a nice [introduction to verbs](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/grammar/parts-of-speech-the-verb/introduction-to-verbs/v/introduction-to-verbs-the-parts-of-speech-grammar) from Khan Academy.
