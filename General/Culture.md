# Culture
Culture is a set of values that people of a certain group practise. Practicing of these common values make them one, a single unit. If these values are unproductive and ineffective, the whole group fails. Similarly, if these values enable and encourages people to do great things, the whole unit flourishes. It is important to keep in mind that putting posters on a wall or setting your desktop wallepaper with your cultural values is a fine but totally ineffective unless you eat, breath, and spread those values through actions, all the time.

At eMumba, our cultural values have enabled us to do great things. We cherish these values, exercise them, and you should too.

## Freedom
In its simplest form, freedom means that no one is going to impose
- What time you come to office
- What dress you are wearing
- Where do you work from
- What tools and technolgoies you use
- What process you follow to get things done
- How you spend your slack time
- How you choose to communicate with your peers

And the list goes on. But freedom at eMumba comes with clear responsibilities.

## Responsibility
Freedom at eMumba comes with a set of assumptions, it is expected that
- Your work routine, ethics, and process is enhancing your team's productivity, not causing bottlenecks
- You behave professionally and respectfully with everyone at all times
- You are effectively communicating (and even over communicating)
- You give and take regular feedbacks in the sprit of improvement
- You have a predictable routine and availability
- You continuously do effort to make improvements in yourself, your team, and your organization
- You can justify your choices to have a positive business and cultural impact

## Accountability
Whether you are exercising freedom with responsibility is the question you should be able to answer. And this answer should match in case your peers are asked the very same question about you.
