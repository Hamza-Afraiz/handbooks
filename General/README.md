# eMumba Developer Handbook

This document highlights some software development and cultural fundamentals that a developer must know and practise at eMumba. Fresh graduates and especially people joining us from non computer science programs are the intended audience. But even if you are an experienced engineer there is no harm in revising these concepts. You are welcome to suggest any changes and improvements in the document, in fact it will be highly appreciated. **Please note although python is used to demonstrate some programming techniques but this is a language independent guide.**
